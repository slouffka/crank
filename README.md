Crank
=====

I am writing this game while learning C++ gamedev using a book “SFML Game Development”.
So most of the code mimics the book samples but is adopted to my own needs as I progress
through the book chapters.

remember anything before that moment. So you as a player should help him to find
out what the hell has happened.
